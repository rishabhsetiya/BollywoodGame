A Movie Name Guessing Game

A player scores points by correctly guessing the correct movie name when the vowels are shown and consonants are hidden. Number of incorrect guesses are limited by the letters in the word "BOLLYWOOD". However, an incorrect guess doesn't count if the next letter to be removed from the word BOLLYWOOD is same as the guessed letter. 

This code was written by me as a project work in senior school for the requirement of the subject Computer Science with C++ (CBSE Board) in the year 2017.
This works on TurboC++ compiler. Many library functions used in this program would not work on modern compilers.

The code contains a few bugs. 
Contact me on rishabhsetiya7@gmail.com if you find out the code responsible for the bug.
